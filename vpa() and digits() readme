THE USE OF VPA() FUNCTION:
vpa() converts the value to a symbol it can be used with the digits() function to control the number of precision bits 
  if vpa() is omitted the last few iterations are rounded off when printed with disp() / fprintf() as they are considered as a double() 
    which MATLAB rounds off so displayed values are not upto sufficient precision especially if more than 6 decimal precision is required

But symbols can have more precision than a double. 
      Ex: digits(100) vpa(pi) gives pi upto 100 digits but is a symbol so arithmetic handeling becomes difficult. 
It sacrifices ease of use for precision.

However vpa() must not be outside the "data" matrix as it causes looped variables to be converted to a symbol and calcution is presented as a
real number like p/q where p and q are some absurd decimal values ex: 412333149201/23120301239 
  this happens because MATLAB considers both the numerator and denominator as a symbol 
    so it is best to avoid lines like x = vpa(b) 
     where x is in a loop or is used for further calculation
